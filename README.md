## About the project

Developed by: _Enricco Gemha_

The project started as an implementation of [Roll-a-ball](https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball?uv=2022.3), an Unity tutorial completed as an assignment for Digital Games at Insper 2024/1.

However, I evolved it to make it similar to a Super Monkey Game.
